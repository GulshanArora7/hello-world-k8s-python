To deploy this application on Production below are the recommendations:

1. Please use Ingress for your service rather than LoadBalancer or NorePort.
2. For production we will need more replica if in case load is high and 3 pods are unable to serve it. So need to use HPA(pod autoscaler) for this.
3. Recommend to use Managed Kubernetes service provided by Public Cloud service provider AWS,Azure,Google Cloud(of course if are using Public Cloud in our Environment).
4. Rolling Deployment Strategy can be given in percenteage(%) as well.
    Example is as below:
    strategy:
      rollingUpdate:
        maxSurge: 25%
        maxUnavailable: 25%

5. Ensure Logs Monitoring setup (ELK) and Kubernetes cluster monitoring using below tools which i feel good.
   A. ELK STACK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
   B. Grafana
   C. Prometheus
   D. Weave Scope for Kubernetes

6. Implement CI/CD pipeling using tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI and any other according to our need.
